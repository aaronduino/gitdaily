# Day 33

When I write my commit message, I want to use my editor
of favorite text, randomly vim. In ~ / .gitconfig, I complete:

[Core]
editor = vim

About commit message, do not hesitate to spread about more
of a line if your patch is not trivial, while keeping the
first line within 50 characters.
