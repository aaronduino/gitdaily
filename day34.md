# Day 34

Some flags of the log command, to decorate your aliases:

--date=relative
for dates to the social network ("n hours ago")
--name-only
to show the name of changed files
--no-merges
is rather explicit
--oneline
will only show the abbreviated SH1 and the commit message
--patch
or -p to display the commit patch

Do not hesitate to send me your aliases, in particular git log,
some will be part of the next episodes =)
